# Test Repository

This is a test repository created to demonstrate basic GitHub operations such as creating a repository, adding code, and pushing it to GitHub.

## Project Overview

The repository contains a simple Python script (`test_script.py`) with basic functions:
- `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers.
- `multiply(a, b)`: Multiplies two numbers.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/test-repository.git
   cd test-repository
   ```

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python test_script.py
   ```

This will display the results of the `add` and `multiply` functions.

## Example Output

When you run the `test_script.py`, you should see something like this:
